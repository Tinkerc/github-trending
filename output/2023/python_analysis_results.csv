HMS-CardiacMR / MyoMapNet,https://github.com/HMS-CardiacMR/MyoMapNet,"We implemented a FC that uses pixel-wise T1-weighted signals and corresponding inversion time to estimate T1 values from a limited number of T1-weighted images. we studied how training the model using native, post-contrast T1 and a combination of both could impact performance of the MyoMapNet. We also explored two choices of number of T1 weighte…",1,2023-01-01
